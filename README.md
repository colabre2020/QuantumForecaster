# QuantumForecaster
This simple quantum forecasting model uses quantum circuits to "learn" from time-series data. It's an introductory concept in quantum machine learning, and though it doesnâ€™t outperform classical algorithms for such tasks, it's a fun way to explore quantum computing and demonstrate quantum-enhanced learning techniques.
